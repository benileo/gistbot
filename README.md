# Gist Bot

Do you have a linux profile or git aliases that you have on multiple computers?

Have you ever thought to yourself, I wish I had my profile file on this machine.

You wouldn't want to wrongly execute commands because you don't have your profile.

These are just examples of reasons to use the Gist Bot. The Gist bot hooks into Github gists and monitors all the gists that you tell it to. Anytime a change is made, changes are auto-commited into your github gist account!
